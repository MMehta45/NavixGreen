  <!--Sections have lines just to show the breakups. Check paragrah tags for ideas on what we could do in each section?-->
  <div class="container text-center">
    <img src="imgs/navixlogo-removebg.png" class="rounded mx-auto d-block" alt="...">
    <p>This can be a container on which the parralax effect is built in if we choose to go down that route? www.firewatchgame.com</p>
    <p>Other things we could do instead of just a carousel is like a high res video/animiaton with some text in front and drop the logo to just the nav bar?</p>
  <h4>Nav Bar?</h4>
  <p>For the nav bar whatever we choose to do the start section I think our nav bar needs to be much lighter than last years. We can add the extra links to a mega footer on the bottom of the page.</p>
  <p>We can maybe do just a hamburger menu for both desktop & mobile.</p>

  <div class="container">
    <p>We could follow the format of like one section being text and image alinged to the left</p>
    <p class="text-center">Then the next one being like a full width feature</p>
    <p class="text-end">And repeat  ( at least for the homepage )</p>

  <div class="container">
    <p> Some ideas for a full width feature</p>
    <p>Since were compiling info aboutt green/clean energy and green practices for homeowners one of the things they want us to include is basic info.
      We could have a section with like a animiated windmill have it talk about what is green/clean energy why need it whatever really.
    </p>
    <p>We could also do cards like we had on last years page but instead of text and img just do img with text on hover?</p>
